# RDFforFountainPen

Currently there are no standard classification methods to order and keep a record of a fountain pen collection of a user on the internet. For example, in Schema.org there are no schema for it. The unique method is that all people with a collection describe one by one all their fountain pens without any standard system. Because of this, I try to give an RDF schema example in Turtle with a ShEx schema for validation that all people can use. With this, the manner to describe and search a fountain pen model in a collection will be easier.

## Characteristics of a Fountain Pen:
-	Nib (optional): Its material (Gold, Steel, etc.), point (F, B, M, etc.), if it is or no flexible, and a little description of the nib written by the user. Only the material is obligatory.
-	Feeder (optional): Its material (Plastic, ebonite, etc.) and a little description of the feeder written by the user. Description is optional.
